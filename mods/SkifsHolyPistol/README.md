# Skif's Holy Pistol

## Backstory

It was an occurrence of such profound and terrifying absurdity that one might only attribute it to the inscrutable whims of a dark Providence. A strange artifact, birthed from the very bowels of the Zone, was cast forth like a fallen soul toward the Mainland. It did not seek the solace of an empty field; no, it sought out the humble, wretched apartment of a man. There, amidst the squalor, it did not merely fall, but struck—with a precision that felt like a divine rebuke—the Makarov pistol of Skif, who previously was engaged in the base act of bludgeoning a rat that had dared to feast upon his meager crust of stale bread.

The dented steel was transfigured. Skif, a man whose soul clung to the tenets of Holy Orthodoxy, beheld the weapon not as a tool of violence, but as a relic of terrible grace. It became light, as if forged from the very essence of titanium, and its fire possessed a grouping so tight it seemed guided by an invisible hand. Yet, as with all miracles in this fallen world, a shadow followed. The pistol began to weep—a vile, malodorous gunk that fouled the mechanism, a physical manifestation of the weapon’s own internal torment. It jammed; it resisted the haste of the trigger. Skif understood: one must approach such power with a slow, deliberate humility, lest the mechanism fail in its agony.

He tested this grace upon a distant container, and the bullet—that singular, indestructible messenger—tore through the very fabric of the city, piercing apartment after apartment until it came to rest in a rusted Zaporozhets three streets away. The bullet remained whole, unyielding. Skif now lives in a state of perpetual spiritual fever, fearing that to aim this weapon at the sun would be to plunge the world into eternal night. And as for the extra round that somehow finds room within the magazine -- a defiance of all physical law -- Skif, in the depths of a vodka-induced delirium, can only conclude that the metal itself has become anomalous.

It is a challenge, a cross to carry, a weapon for a soul that has looked into the abyss.
