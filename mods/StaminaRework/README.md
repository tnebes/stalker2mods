# Preamble

SINCE the Zone is quite large,
SINCE Skif used to be an army man,
SINCE anomalies break laws of physics anyhow,

this mod makes running around the Zone more manageable.

# Description

Stamina has been reworked.

1. Being hydrated decreases stamina use
2. Being hydrated lasts longer
3. Drinking energy drinks increases stamina regen
4. Drinking energy drinks extends stamina regen time.
5. Energy drinks aid with aiming and reload speeds. (maybe.)

Normal scenario: No water and no energy drinks means you stop often to catch your breath.
No water but energy drinks: you will have to stop often but for a shorter time to catch your breath.
Water but no energy drinks: you will be able to sprint for longer, but you will spend more time recuperating.
Water and energy drinks: you will be able to sprint for longer, you will have to take breaks less often, and you will spend less time recuperating.
